To run: Make with "make", then run with "./main" + command line arguments.
First argument is the name of test input file.
Second argument represents scheduling algorithm to use: 
	First In First Out = 0
	Shortest Job First = 1
	Round Robin = 2

If running Round Robin, you must also choose a time quantum which should be a positive integer.

Examples:
To run FIFO, type "./main input10 0"
To run RR with q=2, type "./main input10 2 2"

Use "make clean" to remove exe/object files.
